## How does it work? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This web app takes a URL as an input and detects potentially malicious URLs by performing thorough checks such as blacklist verification, SSL certificate presence, HTTPS usage, and AI prediction. It provides a score and flags for various checks conducted.  The detection process involves several steps:
 - It checks if the URL is present in the top 1 million valid sites database.
 - It verifies if the URL is blacklisted in any of the 40 sources checked.
 - The app checks for the presence of an SSL certificate, ensuring secure communication.
 - The app validates against Google Safe Browsing and Norton Web Safe databases.
 - It checks if the URL is blacklisted in McAfee and Sucuri blacklists.
 - The app identifies temporary domains registered from unsecure sources.
 - It verifies if the URL is older than 3 months.
 - The app checks if the URL is blacklisted in local blacklists and IP sets.
 - It utilizes an AI model to predict the maliciousness of the URL.
 - The app checks if the URL is present in the URL reporting database.
